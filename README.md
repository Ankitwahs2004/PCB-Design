<h1>Design and PCB Development of Safety Circuits for EV Vehicles</h1>
<h2>Project Overview </h2>
This project involves the design and PCB development of critical safety circuits for electric vehicles (EVs), specifically focusing on the TSAL (Traction System Active Light), BSPD (Brake System Plausibility Device), and Shutdown circuits. These circuits were developed using Proteus, and the designs were subsequently translated into PCB layouts by using Altium Software, to ensure robust and reliable performance for our club's electric vehicle project.

<h2>Key Features</h2>
1. TSAL (Traction System Active Light): Indicates the status of the high-voltage system, ensuring it is active and alerting users to potential hazards.
<br>
2. BSPD (Brake System Plausibility Device): Monitors the brake system to ensure it is functioning correctly and can trigger a shutdown if anomalies are detected.
<br>
3. Shutdown Circuit: Provides a fail-safe mechanism to quickly and safely power down the vehicle's systems in case of an emergency.
<h2> Design Tools and Technologies</h2>
Design Software: Proteus
<br>
PCB Design Software: Following the initial circuit design, PCB layouts were created by the help of Altium Software.
